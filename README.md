Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

This place is mostly a collection of random projects I've done for school or for fun.
I like to keep this stuff around to have a sense of my progression as a coder (no matter how painful it is to look at some of my earlier stuff).

If you didn't end up here on accident (and even if you did) I'd like to say thanks for taking interest in what I've been doing over the years.
